			<h1>MARIA BASTIDAS</h1>
			<p>
				Before I ever saw surf photographer Maria Fernanda Bastidas&rsquo; work, I saw her process. Standing behind the barricade of Kamehameha Highway as it ascends and overlooks Waimea Bay, I had just watched two-time world champion Tom Carroll walk up the road carrying the pieces of his big-wave gun, snapped in half by waves with 20-foot-plus faces.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I turned back toward the beach, out of the punishing Waimea Bay shorebreak emerged a woman with fins and a bodyboard ... and a camera housing.
			</p>

			<p>
				Deterred by shore pound, strong currents, a long swim and waves that can close out the entire Bay, very few photographers swim out at Waimea on big days, and even fewer still (and maybe none at all up until a few years ago) have been women.
			</p> 
			<p>
				Growing up landlocked in Mexico City, Bastidas had been on swim team practically all her life, but she had no idea that what she was training for was to eventually become one of a handful of female photographers who swim out at some of the most dangerous waves in the world.
